  <h3>🌞 Introduction to Our Solar System</h3>
  <p>Our solar system is a vast cosmic neighborhood with the Sun at its center, surrounded by planets, moons, asteroids, and comets moving in harmony.</p>

  <h3>🪐 Planetary Lineup</h3>
  <p>There are 8 major planets: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune — each unique in size, composition, and behavior.</p>

  <h3>☿ Mercury: The Swiftest Planet</h3>
  <p>Closest to the Sun, Mercury completes one orbit in just 88 Earth days. Despite its proximity, it's not the hottest planet due to its lack of atmosphere.</p>

  <h3>♀ Venus: Earth's Twin in Size</h3>
  <p>Venus has a dense atmosphere of CO₂, causing a runaway greenhouse effect. It's the hottest planet with surface temperatures over 460°C.</p>

  <h3>🌍 Earth: Our Home Planet</h3>
  <p>Earth is the only known planet to support life, thanks to its liquid water, breathable atmosphere, and ideal distance from the Sun.</p>

  <h3>♂ Mars: The Red Planet</h3>
  <p>Known for its reddish appearance, Mars has the tallest volcano (Olympus Mons) and deep canyons. It may have once hosted water and potentially life.</p>

  <h3>♃ Jupiter: The Gas Giant</h3>
  <p>Jupiter is the largest planet, with strong magnetic fields and over 90 moons. Its Great Red Spot is a massive storm larger than Earth.</p>

  <h3>♄ Saturn: The Ringed Beauty</h3>
  <p>Saturn is famous for its prominent ring system made of ice and rock. It’s also a gas giant and has over 80 known moons, including Titan.</p>

  <h3>♅ Uranus: The Tilted Planet</h3>
  <p>Uranus rotates almost sideways and has a bluish color due to methane in its atmosphere. It is considered an ice giant.</p>

  <h3>♆ Neptune: The Windy Planet</h3>
  <p>Farthest from the Sun, Neptune has supersonic winds and a deep blue color. It has faint rings and the stormy “Great Dark Spot.”</p>

  <h3>🌠 Dwarf Planets: Pluto and Beyond</h3>
  <p>Pluto was reclassified as a dwarf planet in 2006. Others include Eris, Haumea, Makemake, and Ceres — all part of the Kuiper Belt or asteroid belt.</p>

  <h3>🌙 Natural Satellites</h3>
  <p>Many planets have moons — Earth's Moon stabilizes our tilt, while Jupiter's Europa may host a subsurface ocean with life potential.</p>

  <h3>☄️ Asteroids & Comets</h3>
  <p>Asteroids are rocky bodies mostly in the asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter, while comets have icy tails and come from the Oort Cloud or Kuiper Belt.</p>

  <h3>🌌 The Sun: Our Stellar Anchor</h3>
  <p>The Sun is a G-type main-sequence star, providing heat, light, and gravitational force that binds the solar system together.</p>

  <h3>🛰️ Space Missions & Exploration</h3>
  <p>From Voyager to Mars rovers, space missions continue to expand our knowledge. James Webb and upcoming missions will explore farther than ever.</p>

  <h3>🌍 Life Beyond Earth</h3>
  <p>Scientists study exoplanets and icy moons in search of life. Mars, Europa, and Enceladus are top candidates for future exploration.</p>

  <h3>📡 The Heliosphere</h3>
  <p>The solar wind forms a bubble around the solar system called the heliosphere, marking the boundary where solar influence fades.</p>

  <h3>🧭 Orbital Mechanics</h3>
  <p>All solar system objects move in elliptical orbits, governed by gravity and momentum, following Kepler’s and Newton’s laws.</p>

  <h3>🔭 How We Observe Space</h3>
  <p>Telescopes (optical, radio, infrared) and space probes help us study the solar system — from Earth-based observatories to deep-space instruments.</p>

  <h3>📚 Fun Facts & Curiosities</h3>
  <p>Did you know? A day on Venus is longer than its year. Or that Jupiter's moon Ganymede is larger than Mercury?</p>
